Things to do

1. Log plots in lightning tensorboard. At each validation step we plot the prediction error # DONE
2. Logging with colorlog is fine, but internal lightning logs has different format, look if it is possible to align them together # WON'T DO
3. Would be nice to launch tensorboard from the script, currentyl it doesn't work
4. Implement a checkpoint system to resume where last artifacts was created, at least in terms of weight # ALMOST DONE
5. Maybe restructure using xarray?
6. Add intermediate plotting for data preparation and loading
7. Support different full domain size so we can use early forecast/analysis couples. Need to interpolate probably # NOT A GOOD IDEA
8. Normalization is very bad currently moving from CPU to GPU to CPU to GPU too many times. We should go fully pytorch reimplementing the scikit-learn scalers
9. In combo run add the possibility to tun more models with the same setup
