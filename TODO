Things to do

1. Log plots in lightning tensorboard. At each validation step we plot the prediction
2. Logging with colorlog is fine, but internal lightning logs has different format, look if it is possible to align them together
3. Would be nice to launch tensorboard from the script, currentyl it doesn't work
4. Implement a checkpoint system to resume where last artifacts was created, at least in terms of weight # ALMOST DONE
5. Maybe restructure using xarray?
6. Add intermediate plotting for data preparation and loading
7. Support different full domain size so we can use early forecast/analysis couples. Need to interpolate probably
